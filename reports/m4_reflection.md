# Milestone 4 Reflection

## What we have implemented in Milestone 4

### 1. Data Wrangling:
- Removed Antarctica from the world map due to minimal observations.
- Dropped latitude and longitude columns in the processed data for simplicity.
- Adopted Parquet format for faster data loading.

### 2. Functionality Enhancements:
- Excluded pollution types lacking AQI standards to streamline data relevance.
- Integrated a 'Learn More' button for detailed explanations of AQI and pollution types.
- Implemented a regression trend line to smooth data over a longer window, highlighting general trends.
- Resolved an issue where plots were not displaying with default selections in Milestone 3.
- Restricted user selections to a maximum of four to prevent overcrowding of the visual display.
- Enhanced performance and loading efficiency through multiple approaches including using DuckDB connections of vegafusion, adding caching to callbacks, and filtering data with queries.

### 3. Aesthetic Improvements:
- Adjusted minor chart elements: renamed legend titles, sorted legends by order, and removed the y-axis on bar charts.
- Hid unnecessary axis titles and aligned font sizes across chart titles.
- Set a custom Favicon for the dashboard for better branding.

### 4. Repository Structure:
- Removed unnecessary packages from the requirements.txt file to clean up dependencies.
- Added a Creative Commons license to ensure the open-source availability and usage of the dashboard.

### 5. Documentation:
- Enhanced the README file to clearly state the questions our dashboard addresses and the functionality it provides.

## Divergence from Original Sketch

- We have introduced a data summary section that provides summary statistics for the filtered data. This addition helps users understand the number of observations being plotted and their value range.
- We repositioned the filters to centralize the pollutant and time selections at the top of the dashboard, enhancing the logical flow and making it clearer for users to understand which filters control specific parts of the dashboard. We also strategically separated the map and trend chart with corresponding region and country filters to further improve usability.

## Divergence from Best Practices

- The dashboard now performs significantly better on render.com due to our targeted performance enhancements. We believe that the dashboard is currently optimized based on the available data.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Advantages:
- **Efficiency**: The dashboard loads efficiently, with a neat, concise, and clear visual styling.
- **User Experience**: Filters are thoughtfully designed to enhance user interaction, including features such as centering the map post-selection and filtering out choices with no available data to streamline the user experience.

### Disadvantages:
- **Limited Chart Variety**: The variety of charts is currently limited due to time constraints and the availability of data. This restriction has impacted our ability to add more diverse features and perform broader analyses.

## Future Improvements and Additions

### Predictive Model and Visualization of "Danger Zones"
- We aim to build a predictive model that highlights "danger zones" based on pollution trends, using historical pollution and traffic data. This model will likely use multiple linear regression and random forest regressors to forecast future pollution levels. A visualization feature will enable users to identify potentially high-pollution areas effectively.

### Real-Time Pollution Data API
- We plan to develop an API to retrieve the latest pollution data from the World Health Organization (WHO). This API will process the data and update our dashboard continuously, ensuring that users have access to the most current information without needing to manually upload data.

### Enhanced Dashboard Performance
- To address latency issues and enhance user engagement, we will optimize our dashboardâ€™s performance using caching, memoization, and WebGL graphics. WebGL will leverage GPU capabilities to render graphics more efficiently than traditional SVGs, improving the overall speed and responsiveness of the dashboard.
