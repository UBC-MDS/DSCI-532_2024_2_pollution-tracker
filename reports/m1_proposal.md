# Milestone 1 Proposal - Polution Tracker
Group 2 - Merete Lutz, Kun Ya, Weiran Zhao, Sid Grover

## Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: Public health officials

Air pollution is worldwide one of the greatest threats to human and environmental health. Pollutants like particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone ($O_3$) are inhaled and absorbed into the body through the lungs, leading to an increased risk of mortality and diseases like stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and pneumonia. This increased risk of morbidity and mortality can be seen after a relatively short exposure period for some pollutants, and at-risk populations such as the elderly, children, and pregnant women are particularly susceptible to the effets of air pollution. To address this global issue, we propose an air pollution visualization app that will help public health officials tease apart pollutant trends both locally and globally, so that they may better advise their population through air quality advisories and public health measures.
